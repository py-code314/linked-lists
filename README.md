# Solution for The Odin Project's Project: Linked Lists

## Overview

This project is a part of the assignment for The Odin Project. The goal of this project is to practice creating and manipulating linked lists using JavaScript. As part of the project I created a linked list class and implemented various methods to add, remove, and find nodes in the list. I also implemented a toString method to display the contents of the list.

List of methods:
- `append(value)`: Adds a new node with the given value to the end of the linked list.
- `prepend(value)`: Adds a new node with the given value to the beginning of the linked list.
- `size()`: Returns the number of nodes in the linked list.
- `head()`: Returns the first node in the linked list.
- `tail()`: Returns the last node in the linked list.
- `at(index)`: Returns the node at the given index in the linked list.
- `pop()`: Removes the last node from the linked list.
- `contains(value)`: Returns true if the linked list contains a node with the given value, false otherwise.
- `find(value)`: Returns the index of the first occurrence of a node with the given value in the linked list.
- `toString()`: Returns a string representation of the linked list, displaying the values of each node in the list. 
- `insertAt(value, index)`: Inserts a new node with the given value at the specified index in the linked list.
- `removeAt(index)`: Removes the node at the specified index from the linked list.
